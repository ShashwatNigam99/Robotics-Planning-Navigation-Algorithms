## RRT : Rapidly-exploring Random Tree
- Implement the RRT path planning algorithm for a robot. The robot is to navigate a two dimensional space, avoiding known locations with obstacles, traveling from its initial location to a goal location. Given localization information (robotâ€™s initial position, obstacle location, goal location), your task is to implement a path planning decision maker to drive the robot from its
initial position to the desired location. 
- Specifically, the problem can be formed as follows: Consider a 2D grid instantiated with different kinds of obstacles (for instance, geometrical shapes like Rectangles, Circles, Triangles or a combination of any
of the above 2/3). Assign a start and end point on this grid. 
- Implement the RRT algorithm for two cases, (1) Holonomic Robot and (2) Non-Holonomic Robot.
